VisualSc is a graphical state chart editor built on Qt.
It adds graphical attributes to state elements in a SCXML file.

When completed, the project will include statemachine engines
(in various languages) that read SCXML directly so that one
can design a state machine graphically and transform that image
into a running statemachine (via SCXML files) bypassing the source
code phase. Additionally, VisualSc will allow a developer to annimate
actual state chart execution using debug tracing from the runtime machines.
